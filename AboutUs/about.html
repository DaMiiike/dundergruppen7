    <section class="about_section">
      It all started with a vision of reducing the every day consume of
      disposable plastic that unfortunately still is a big issue in the world.
      Every minute 1 million plastic bottles are sold worldwide and the
      production of plastic is threatening our planet. The normal yearly waste
      of one person is around 400kg and the most of that waste is from
      disposable plastic that is not reusable. Our idea builds on to take action
      and use our precious access to clean tap water with our Wonder Bottle
      rather than buying plastic bottles. The production is located in Sweden to
      minimize the emission of carbon dioxide during shipping and also to
      strengthen the local production. We behind Wonder Bottle stands for to
      take up the fight against plastic and do what we can do to create a more
      sustainable consumption and to inspire more people to make a cleaver
      choice of bottle.
